## Shared files
 
Select the files that you want to share:

(Only for windows)

These files are now being shared and can be sent or retrieved by computers on the same network that have Clepnid open or can interact with them via the computer's url.

It can also be shared to smartphones connected to the same network using qr.

Each file can be downloaded and to interact with them you will have to add the modules related to these files.

## How add modules html:

Go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Clepnid\src\html and copy the modulo.

With these modules we can add shared file interactions (by default there is only the download button):

And by introducing, for example, the music player module in the mp3 files, we will add the functionality of playing said file.

And it will be accessed from the web and in this case it can be reproduced with the previously added module.

The name will be the one shown to be recognized within localhost by the other computers that want to send files.

The folder path will be where you get the files sent by other computers.

## Utilities

Or don't write any subdomain name, getting a random url.
